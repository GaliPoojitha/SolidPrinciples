# SolidPrinciples
This little project is all about getting hands-on with SOLID principles through simple, clear code examples â€” each principle shown on its own, then brought together to build a neat, practical demo.
Itâ€™s like watching different pieces click perfectly without any chaos.
Youâ€™ll see how breaking things down helps keep your code clean, flexible, and ready for whatever comes next.
Just run the main method and watch the magic of well-designed code in action!
Great for anyone eager to level up their coding skills with easy-to-understand lessons.
Jump in, explore, and have fun mastering the art of writing smarter software!
Letâ€™s make coding less confusing and more enjoyable together! ðŸŽ‰
